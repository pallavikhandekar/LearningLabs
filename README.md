PaaS-for-Gamification-of-Learning
=================================

The aim of this project is to create  a unified cloud platform for gamification of learning. This application will provide a platform which allows users to use the developed interactive games, varied user interfaces based on roles, instant feedbacks to improve the learning experience of their students. It will help professors choose games and customize it on the go, based on live data from students (voting or live answers from students) or static data.
A real time semantic analysis of data will be done based on users input to provide instant feedbacks. At the same time it will manage registrations, roles, badges, ranks, scores and also help them track individual or team progress by visualizing the dashboards. The product being deployed as Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS) ensures more accessibility, scalability and cost-efficiency. The data independence will be provided with multi-tenancy features so that this platform can be used by multiple professors in future for their individual courses.
